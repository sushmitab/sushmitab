Talk title: Sequential Decision-Making under Uncertainties for Real-World Problems

Abstract: Autonomous decision-making is ubiquitous in cyber-physical systems, facilitating artificial intelligence for large-scale problems where an optimal solution is intractable. My research focuses on designing cost-effective multi-agent approximate algorithms with underlying theoretical foundations for sequential decision-making problems. I study Reinforcement Learning-based solutions that work efficaciously under realistic computation and communication constraints, with partial observations of uncertain and dynamic environments. In this talk, I will also go over my work on applications, including city-scale taxicab pickup schedules with dynamic demand models and autonomous routing in the wild for marine life observation.
